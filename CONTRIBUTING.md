## ‚úÖ What we do when reviewing your PR

- We manually review all changes (there is no automatic merge).
- We check:
    - That the code is clean, readable, and consistent.
    - That there‚Äôs no obfuscated, malicious, or unnecessary code.
    - That the changes don‚Äôt break other parts of the project.
- If we find anything to adjust, we‚Äôll leave comments in the PR for you.

<br>

## üöÄ What happens after

- If the contribution is approved, it will be merged into the `contributions` branch.
- We will test the changes locally to ensure everything works correctly.
- Once everything looks great, we will merge the updates into the `main` branch as part of an official release.

- Please check the project Wiki ‚Äî you‚Äôll find visual explanations and documentation that can help you.
